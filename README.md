# camera-qr-wifi
Read QR from camera and connect to WiFi if possible.

## Usecase
* I want to have a hidden SSID with a very long password, but I need it to be easy to add new devices to the network
* Tools to encode SSID and password into a QR code are readily available
* On a mobile phone, you can use [Barcode Scanner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android) or iOS camera to scan this QR code and get a prompt to connect to the WiFi network
* On a laptop or Macbook there does not seem a convenient solution for this

Nothing creative, just trying to put a couple of libraries together and see how this works out.
